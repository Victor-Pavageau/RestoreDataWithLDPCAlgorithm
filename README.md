## About

This project is a Python simulation for encoding, introducing noise, and decoding data using DNA as a storage medium. The script tests the application of the LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) algorithm for error correction in DNA storage, simulating real-world mutation rates of up to 15%. By leveraging photolithography for DNA synthesis, the project evaluates the feasibility of reliable and cost-effective DNA-based data storage.

This project was undertaken during my second year of engineering studies (Bac+4 in the French education system) as part of a school assignment, involving the writing of a research paper on a novel topic. Collaborating as a team of four, we combined biotechnology and computer science to propose and simulate an experimental approach, gaining hands-on experience in interdisciplinary research and teamwork.
